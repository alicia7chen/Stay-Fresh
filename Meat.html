  <h2> General Storage Of Meat </h2><br>
  <h3> Store raw meat and poultry in clean, sealed containers on the bottom shelf of the fridge.<br>
  Follow any storage instructions on the label and don't eat meat after its use-by date.<br>
  Keep cooked meat separate from raw meat and ready to eat foods in general.<br>
  It's safe to freeze meat and fish as long as you:<br>
  freeze it any time before its use-by date<br>
  defrost meat and fish thoroughly before cooking â€“ lots of liquid will come out as meat thaws, so stand it in a bowl to stop bacteria in the juice spreading to other things<br>
  defrost meat or fish in a microwave if you intend to cook straight away, or if not, defrost in the fridge overnight so it doesn't get too warm<br>
  cook food until it's steaming hot throughout<br>
  Make sure meat is properly wrapped in the freezer or it might get freezer burn, which can make it tough and inedible.<br>
Date and label meat in the freezer and eat it within 24 hours of defrosting.<br>
You can freeze meat for a long time and it will still be safe to eat, but it's best to eat it within three to six months.<br>
Never re-freeze raw meat (including poultry) or fish that has been defrosted.<br>
You can cook frozen meat and fish once defrosted, and then refreeze them.<br>
You can re-freeze cooked meat and fish once, as long as they have been cooled before going into the freezer. If in doubt, don't re-freeze.<br>
Frozen raw foods can be defrosted once and stored in the fridge for up to 24 hours before they need to be cooked or thrown away.</h3><br>
