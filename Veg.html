  <h2 class = "cursive"> General Storage Of Vegetables </h2><br>
  <h3 class = "words"> 
  Refrigeration can damage some vegetables (such as potatoes), yielding an off-flavour or mushy texture.<br>
Keep vegetables that are not stored in the refrigerator (such as potatoes and onions) away from heat sources and out of sunlight.<br>
Some vegetables (like tomatoes and eggplants) can be left on the counter to ripen and then refrigerated to extend their lifespan.<br>
When storing veggies in plastic bags, make sure to poke some holes in the bag to allow for proper air circulation. Or buy perforated plastic vegetable bags.<br>
Keep vegetables and fruits in separate produce drawers because some fruits, such as apples and pears, produce a substance called ethylene that hastens ripening of other produce.<br>
Do not store potatoes and onions together because they each give off gases that can cause the rapid decay of the other.<br>
Although some vegetables can last for long periods of time when properly stored, try to use them sooner, rather than later, for optimal flavour and nutrient value.<br>
Add crispness back to limp veggies like celery and asparagus by placing them stem-side down in a small amount of water; refrigerate until crisp.<br>
Last but not least, do not wash vegetables until you're ready to eat them<br>
